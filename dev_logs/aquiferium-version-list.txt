Tracking document for the various scaffolding and templates used to generate each version of the aquiferium app during technology selection phase.

-------------------------------
Test 01 - generator-angular

Scaffolded with the standard yeoman generator-angular to create the basic framework.
Includes unit tests via jasmine and karma.
Includes e2e testing but not preconfigured.
NOTE: This can be either configured, or protractor shimmed in for e2e testing later.
Uses grunt for livereload, watch, tests, builds, etc.

-------------------------------
Test 02 - angular-seed

Scaffolded with angular-seed from AngularJS team to create the basic framework.
Includes unit tests via jasmine and karma.
Includes full e2e testing via protractor.
Uses npm for tests, builds, etc.
No live reload or watch.

-------------------------------
Test 03 - generator-cgk-angular

Scaffolded with yeoman generatror-cgk-angular by wooboo to create the basic framework.
Deviates from the standard structure of the Angular-way though otherwise a clean setup.
Includes unit tests via jasmine.
Includes no e2e testing.

-------------------------------
Test 04 - angular enterprise seed

Scaffolded with angular enterprise seed by robert j christian to create the basic framework.
Deviates from the standard structure of the Angular-way.
This is a confusing and bloated setup imo.

-------------------------------
Test 05 - generator-angularseed

Scaffolds a clean structure but on grunt serve config included.
Runs clean under UniZ server, but no livereload.
Cannot get tests to run succesfully from clean build.

-------------------------------
Test 06 - generator-cg-angular

Scaffolds a very light-weight structure with no bloat.
All additional modules and components must be generated as needed.
Allows for best-practices by Google Angular team.
Includes unit tests via jasmine - skeleton tests are autogenerated.
Includes no e2e testing.
NOTE: protractor can be shimmed in for this later.

-------------------------------
Test 07 - generator-angular

Scaffolded with the standard yeoman generator-angular to create the basic framework.
Includes unit tests via jasmine and karma.
Includes e2e testing but not preconfigured.
NOTE: This can be either configured, or protractor shimmed in for e2e testing later.
Uses grunt for livereload, watch, tests, builds, etc.

NOTES:
Redoing this approach with a different tack on establishing the automated livereload/watch/testing features.
If succesful, this will be the candidate for starting.
UPDATE: Got the e2e testing and unit testing properly configured and using grunt-karma with jasmine.

-------------------------------

Decision:

Winner is Test 07. It is the simplest to build on, includes functional unit testing out-of-the-box, and is well documented. Also I extended the testing for e2e.

Runner up is the Test 06 results - an excellent scaffolding, but too complicated to spin-up quickly. Will revisit later for potential migration of Aqiferium after initial dev is functional.

Test 02 gets honorable mention, and while it is the official Angualr team seed, it lacks the livereload and watch features out-of-the-box that are more useful at this time.
