== Best Practice Recommendations for Angular App Structure

Proposal:

  Change angular-seed, yeoman/generator-angular, (the Google-internal example go/nghellostyle), and other demo apps to model the following directory structure. Eventually, develop tooling to make development more efficient using assumptions based on these conventions.

Motivation:

  Our toy and demo apps currently group files functionally (all views together, all css together, etc...) rather than structurally (all elements of a view together, all common elements together, etc...)
  When used in a real larger scale app (e.g. Doubleclick For Advertisers), readability is improved by making the directory and app structure consistent with the architectural design of the app. We also want to be able to develop tools to make app creation and management easier, and this is simplified with a common structure.
  This proposal outlines a more functional structure based on a repeating hierarchy and some use-case examples.

  For more on motivation and the need for a recommendation of some kind, see this lengthy discussion https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular/issues/109

Why a fractal hierarchy?

  We wanted to be able to create a common set of rules that can be applied to a logical unit within an application. The application developer can then decide how many logical units are necessary, and apply the rules to all of them in the same way. This makes it easier for large applications to develop a structure that reflects the application itself, while applying the same rules at each level of the hierarchy.
  This structure will make it possible for us to develop common tooling for Angular apps, and also support future plans for Angular where routing better supports greater modularity of views.

Why propose naming conventions?

  We want to address a couple of issues that we see now in Angular code:
  It's fairly common now to have the same name used for different kinds of .js files -- a Service and a Filter both using the same name, for example. When editing files in an IDE it can be hard at a glance to tell which is which. Adding a naming convention for types of files helps to resolve this.
  There are currently multiple ways of organizing by extension or naming convention. Unit tests, for example, are named *_test.js, *.spec.js, or test/*.js, depending on who wrote the code. Having a single recommendation makes it easier to develop tools.

Got an edge case we haven't anticipated?

  Tell us about it! We're interested in hearing what we might have missed.

== Proposed Example Directory Structure

Recursive hierarchical structure

  We propose a recursive structure, the base unit of which contains a module definition file (app.js), a controller definition file (app-controller.js), a unit test file (app-controller_test.js), an HTML view (index.html or app.html) and some styling (app.css) at the top level, along with directives, filters, services, protos, e2e tests, in their own subdirectories.

Components and Sub-sections

  We group elements of an application either under a "components" directory (for common elements reused elsewhere in the app), or under meaningfully-named directories for recursively-nested sub-sections that represent structural "view" elements or routes within the app:

Components

  A components directory contains directives, services, filters, and related files.
  Common data (images, models, utility files, etc.) might also live under components (e.g. components/lib/), or it can be stored externally.
  Components can have subcomponent directories, including appended naming where possible.
  Components may contain module definitions, if appropriate. (See "Module definitions" below.)

Sub-sections

  These top-level (or nested) directories contains only templates (.html, .css), controllers, and module definitions.  
  We stamp out sub-level child sub-sections using the same unit template (i.e., a section is made up of templates, controllers, and module definitions), going deeper and deeper as needed to reflect the inheritance of elements in the UI.
  For a very simple app, with just one controller, sub-section directories might not be needed, since everything is defined in the top-level files.
  Sub-sections may or may not have their own modules, depending on how complex the code is.  (See "Module definitions" below.)

Module definitions

  In general, 'angular.module('foo')' should be called only once. Other modules and files can depend on it, but they should never modify it.
  Module definition can happen in the main module file, or in subdirectories for sections or components, depending on the application's needs.

Naming conventions

  We lean heavily on the Google JavaScript Style Guide naming conventions and propose a few additions:
  Each filename should describe the file's purpose by including the component or view sub-section that it's in, and the type of object that it is as part of the name. For example, a datepicker directive would be in components/datepicker/datepicker-directive.js.
  Controllers, Directives, Services, and Filters, should include controller, directive, service, and filter in their name.
  File names should be lowercase, following the existing JS Style recommendations. HTML and css files should also be lowercase.
  Unit tests should be named ending in _test.js, hence  "foo-controller_test.js" and "bar-directive_test.js"
  We prefer, but don't require, that partial templates be named something.html rather than something.ng. (This is because, in practice, most of the templates in an Angular app tend to be partials.)

== Examples

__________________________________
A Very Simple App Example

Consider a very simple app with one directive and one service:
---
sampleapp/                 the client app and its unit tests live under this directory        
   app.css
   app.js
   app-controller.js
   app-controller_test.js
   components/        module def'n, services, directives, filters, and related
   foo/                files live here. "foo" describes what the module does.
            foo.js     The 'foo' module is defined here.
              foo-directive.js
              foo-directive_test.js
              foo-service.js
              foo-service_test.js        
   index.html                        
e2e-tests/                                e2etests are outside the scope of this
sampleapp-backend/                        proposal, but could be at the same level as
backend/ and sampleapp/... we leave this
up to the developer.                
---
Or, in the case where the directive and the service are unrelated, we'd have:
---
sampleapp/ 
  app.css
  app.js                        
  app-controller.js
  app-controller_test.js
  components/
 bar/                                "bar" describes what the service does
    bar.js
    bar-service.js
    bar-service_test.js
 foo/                                "foo" describes what the directive does
    foo.js
    foo-directive.js
    foo-directive_test.js
index.html                        
---
This structure is recommended, not prescriptive. However by using some other format  in some cases (or, for example, by moving the directives and services upwards in the hierarchy to live under sampleapp/) instead of grouping them under components/ we would need to develop separate tooling for large and small apps. We are aiming to define a single spec that can be implemented and automated against. Pragmatically, the recommendation as a best practice here means "we'll build tools that are primarily compatible with this proposed structure".

__________________________________
A More Complex App Example

For a more complex app -- for example, a ticketing application that has a user and an admin login, where some sections of the UI and routing are common to both users while other subsections are only available to one or the other, we want to isolate files belonging to each component, thus:
---                                        
sampleapp/
  app.css
  app.js                            top-level configuration, route defâ€™ns for the app
  app-controller.js
  app-controller_test.js
  components/
    adminlogin/                                
      adminlogin.css                styles only used by this component
      adminlogin.js                 optional file for module definition
      adminlogin-directive.js                         
      adminlogin-directive_test.js        
    private-export-filter/
      private-export-filter.js
      private-export-filter_test.js
    userlogin/
      somefilter.js
      somefilter_test.js
      userlogin.js
      userlogin.css                
      userlogin.html                
      userlogin-directive.js
      userlogin-directive_test.js
      userlogin-service.js
      userlogin-service_test.js                
  index.html
  subsection1/
    subsection1.js
    subsection1-controller.js
    subsection1-controller_test.js
    subsection1_test.js                         
    subsection1-1/                        
      subsection1-1.css
      subsection1-1.html
      subsection1-1.js
      subsection1-1-controller.js
      subsection1-1-controller_test.js
    subsection1-2/                        
  subsection2/
    subsection2.css
    subsection2.html
    subsection2.js
    subsection2-controller.js
    subsection2-controller_test.js
  subsection3/
    subsection3-1/
  etc...

As Applied to the Public Phonecat App

    phones/
      nexus-s.0.jpg
      nexus-s.1.jpg
      nexus-s.2.jpg
      nexus-s.3.jpg

  js/
    app.js
